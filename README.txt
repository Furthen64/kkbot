This is a bot made in C# for our discord server "Hagfors Spelnätverk"



What you need to get it to work:

* If opening the project, in solution explorer it might say "You are targeting a .NET platform not install, " 
press the Install button there to install .NET 3.1 

* Startup Visual Studio Community IDE
- Install nuget 'Newtonsoft.Json'
- Add another Nuget source:

	https://nuget.emzi0767.com/api/v3/index.json
- Install "DSharp", "DSharp CommandsNext" and "DSharp Interactivity"
- NOW you open the Solution, not before. If you accidentily opened the "kkbot" solution before, close it, then open it again!




Old notes:

* When installing Visual Studio Community, make sure you select the:
 [x] .NET Core cross-platform development option.
